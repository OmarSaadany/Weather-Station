Issues 

	1- 	Problem: 
			While transmitting/receiving USART Frames from NPK Sensor (Putty) did not display the data 
			that is because (putty) is not able to display a hex array it displays ASCII only
		Solution: 
			use an app called Cool Trem... you can find it in the tools folder
			
	
	2- 	Problem:
			in the first trial, GSM could not upload data to Google sheet while it was able to access another link 
			thats becouse of the GSM version,it was v13.08.
		Solution:
			you must use v14 or higher, check this by using the below AT commend
			AT+ATI
	
	3- 	Problem:
			the used converter between sensor and MC was not working 
		Solution:
			this converter needs to be connected as below
					Converter_TX ---> MC_TX
					Converter_RX ---> MC_RX
					this not common and not standerd but this how its work 
					(the manufacrer POV: its not creating a frame it only convert and pass it)
